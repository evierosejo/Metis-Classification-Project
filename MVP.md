# Predicting NYC Housing's ENERGY STAR Eligibility

The goal of this project is to understand which factors are most important in making a residential building eligible to be ENERGY STAR certified, and to be able to predict a building's status given its energy and water metrics. 

In order to accomplish this, I have built a baseline logistic regression fit to the numerical features without null values and the target, ENERGY STAR Elgibility (Yes:1, No:0).

This model has an accuracy score of 0.745.
